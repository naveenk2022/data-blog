I'm a Database Engineer at [Trailhead Biosystems, Cleveland](https://www.trailbio.com). 
My research interests include Deep Learning, Bioinformatics, Biostatistics and Geospatial Analytics. In my spare time I enjoy art, swimming, hiking and cooking.

This is my personal little nerd cave. I like to share the work I do on my blog. I hope you find something useful here!
